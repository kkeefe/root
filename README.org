* Root files - store examples of root files which do various things
** Root histograms
*** Here are some examples of filling root histograms
**** hist 1
     utilizes a random fill of numbers.
     two different histograms are presented with different binning
**** hist 2
     an example of three histograms to compare random dice tosses
     the third histogram displays the frequency of the sum of the previous two dices
**** hist 3
     this is very similar to histogram 2, except at the end it spits out data onto the io stream and shows the entry #'s and counts
**** hist 4
     still open with current work to be done..

** Root graphs
*** Examples of root graphs. 
    Some examples of 1-D and N-D graphs are shown..
    Most common types unique to graphs:
    TF1 (or TFN) which describes the number of variables of a function..
    TCanvas - allows for multiple graphs to be placed on 
**** C1
     this is an example of a macro generated form the root canvas interface..
**** GraphTest.C
     first example of a self generated 1-D graph. 
     Very simple single graph template..
**** formula1.C
     this is an example using TCanvas to plot and display 3 different types of graphs..
     the third graph is a type TF2 which is a 2-variable function and plotted as such..


** Root functions
** NTC specific root files and shell scrips
